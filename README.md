Chess engine based on VICE, written in C.

Added features include an enhanced evaluation function, PV search, a variety of game recording and logging functions, and Syzygy tablebase support.

-------
Tablebase support is made possible with the Fathom API, based on Ronald de Man's original Syzygy TB probing code and subsequently modified by Basil and Jon Dart.  All the code is provided under permissive licenses - Ronald de Man's original code can be "redistributed and/or modified without restrictions", and Jon Dart and Basil's modifications are released under the MIT License.
